This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques. Specifically, the aim is toidentify the type of a blood cell.
Each blood cell could be of one of 8 types: Basophil, Eosinophil, Erythroblast, Immature granulocytes, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, Platelet.
The first objective is to inspect data and tryout different data processing techniques for featureextraction. 
After feature extraction we proceed with model development by selecting the appropriate loss function, architecture and depth of CNN, as well as identifying the best hyperparameters through K-fold validation.
