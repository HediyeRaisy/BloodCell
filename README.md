This project focuses on image classification using
deep learning techniques. Specifically, the aim is to
identify the type of a blood cell.
Each blood cell could be of one of 8 types: Basophil, Eosinophil, Erythroblast, Immature granulocytes, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, Platelet.
The first objective is to inspect data and try
out different data processing techniques for feature
extraction. After feature extraction we proceed
with model development by selecting the appropriate loss function, architecture and depth of
CNN, as well as identifying the best hyperparameters through K-fold validation.
